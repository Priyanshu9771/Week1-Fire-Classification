🔥 Classification of Fire Types in India Using MODIS Satellite Data
📌 Project Description
This project focuses on classifying different fire types across India using MODIS satellite data. The goal is to process, analyze, and visualize fire incident data to understand patterns and identify the types of fires (such as agricultural, forest, etc.) using various machine learning techniques.

📁 Dataset
Source: MODIS Satellite Data
Format: CSV or similar structured format
Features: Latitude, Longitude, Brightness, Scan, Track, FRP (Fire Radiative Power), Confidence, Date, Time, etc.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
Scikit-learn (for classification models)
Jupyter Notebook

✅ Tasks Performed
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, etc.)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Classification using ML models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM)
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
Visualization of fire locations and classification results

📊 Results
Achieved an accuracy of XX% using best-performing model.
Found that <key insights, e.g., forest fires are more frequent in certain regions>.
(Note: You can update this with your actual model and results)

📌 How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu9771/Week1-Fire-Classification.git
cd Week1-Fire-Classification
Open the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
Run the cells sequentially.

📚 Future Scope
Use deep learning models for better accuracy.
Incorporate real-time data via APIs.
Add a web dashboard for live monitoring.
