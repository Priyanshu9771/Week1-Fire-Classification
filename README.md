# 🔥 Classification of Fire Types in India Using MODIS Satellite Data

This project focuses on classifying different fire types in India using MODIS satellite data. The analysis involves data preprocessing, visualization, and application of machine learning techniques to identify patterns in fire incidents across Indian regions.

## 📌 Objectives

* Load and explore MODIS fire dataset
* Clean and preprocess the data
* Analyze spatial and temporal patterns of fire events
* Build a classification model using machine learning
* Visualize trends and prediction results

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset includes various parameters related to fire detection:

* **latitude, longitude** – Location of fire
* **brightness** – Intensity of fire event
* **scan, track** – Satellite scanning details
* **acq\_date, acq\_time** – Date and time of data collection
* **confidence** – Confidence level of fire detection
* **version, type, daynight** – Metadata for classification

**Source**: MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Satellite Fire Data
